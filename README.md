## Task 6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Problem Statement: Given some features of a flower (iris dataset)with their respective target names. Build a model to analyze and categorize the flower based on its features.

Approach: This type of problems belong to classification problems. We can solve this by using supervised machine learning classification algorithm (such as SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier).
